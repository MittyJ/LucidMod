Lucid Mod [ALPHA] aims to add a new fleshed out subworld/dimension to Terraria.
This is my first mod it is open source and open to pull requsts
Please give me any feedback in either comments or Discord
This is a very early alpha of the mod and was only made in a few days as a proof of concept

The mod aims to add a new dimension with quests and NPCs along with difficult bossfights that require using the new Monk Class.
Beware this mod messes with the players inventory when changing dimensions. It should work perfectly fine but I would recommend using a new character with this mod.
Another key point to this mod is that its progression is completely isolated from other mods and vanilla, so in theory it should be balanced with any content mod(Calamity, Thorium, ect) because the bosses from this mod can only be fought with armor and weapons from this mod.

The mod starts when you get access to the Ponderer town NPC after defeating king slime. With him you can access the new dimension the "LUCID JUNGLE".

I do plan to update this mod, and I have a lot of plans for what is to come. I want to flesh out the current content, add more, and hopefully more bosses. As the mod is in Alpha most of content and mechanics may change.
